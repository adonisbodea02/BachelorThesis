Due to the fact that Flutter is an SDK which is larger than 100MB and all the weights of all the runs of all the models tried also occupy more than 100MB, this archive contains only the Python source files and the H5 files of the deployed models in the case of the prediction server and model analysis, while for the mobile application the files included are the Dart source files, the assets files (a json file in this case) and the configuration file. Nevertheless, all the code is found on my Github page and can be accessed with the following link: https://github.com/adonisbodea02/BachelorThesis
